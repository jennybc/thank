``` r
thank::you()
```

Will pick a random gif from a dataset of thank you gifs and copy the markdown into your clipboard so it can be used in GitHub comments and other venues.

If you have favorite thank you gifs you like pull requests are welcome, however I would like to keep the gifs free of real life people if possible.
